# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using **C#** and the **.NET Framework**.  
They reflect the programming concepts I learned, such as classes, methods, operators, interfaces, and MVC web applications.

## Projects

- [Car Insurance](#car-insurance)
- [NFL Stats](#nfl-stats)
- [Console Assignments](#console-assignments)

### Car Insurance
This is an **MVC web application** that mimics a car insurance website.  
- Takes user input on policy information.  
- Calculates a quote based on business logic.  
- Includes an **admin page** for staff to view issued quotes.

### NFL Stats
This is a **data visualization application** that stores and displays football stats for fantasy football.  
- Built as an MVC web app.  
- Uses **Entity Framework 6** and a **Code First workflow**.  
- Still a work in progress, but demonstrates database integration and model relationships.

### Console Assignments
A collection of **beginner C# console projects** from coursework:  
- Method Class Assignment (methods, named parameters).  
- Operators Assignment (operator overloading).  
- Polymorphism Assignment (interfaces and polymorphic behavior).  
- Package Express (basic logic and conditionals).  

These small apps show my understanding of **OOP principles** like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Technical Skills Learned
- C# programming fundamentals (methods, loops, conditionals).  
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, interfaces).  
- Operator overloading and polymorphism.  
- Working with **ASP.NET MVC**.  
- **Entity Framework 6** and database workflows.  
- Using **Git/GitHub** for version control and project hosting.
